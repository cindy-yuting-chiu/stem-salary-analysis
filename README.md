# What Affects Salaries for STEM Positions? 

## Introduction

Many International students leave their countries to pursue careers in a STEM-related field, including positions like software engineers, business analysts, and data scientists. There’s no cur- rent research paper on what influences the salary of STEM-related positions, yet there are some news articles that have performed analysis on the salary for STEM-related positions. The articles focus on comparing the salary difference between each year, providing a general overview of the industry but not insights for individual companies.
In this analysis, we want to understand what possible factors that might influence the total yearly compensation for STEM-related positions. The analysis is split into two parts. In the first part, we aim to analyze whether companies have different standards for salary across the same position. In addition, we want to examine whether the location has an impact on the compensa- tion. A hierarchical model will be used to evaluate the variances across different companies and countries. In the second part, we want to see if other demographic features will have an impact on the compensation. This analysis fits two different hierarchical models to compare whether taking account of personal background explains the salary more than the candidate’s working experience.

## Summary
The analysis examines how different factors might influence the total yearly compensation and specifically focuses on how the salaries vary from location and company. Our model indicates that around 71% of the variation in total compensation can be explained by countries and compa- nies. The analysis of the model showed that the salaries are different from countries by title and different from companies. The model indicates interesting interactions like title and experience. In addition, both years of experience and years at the company increase the salary slightly regardless of location and title.
